# ðŸ§ª CHANGE LOG from `e23133e` onwards

1. Commit **945c62e**: Basic Express app with routes setup
   1. Mongoose Model added.
   2. Routes Setup.
   3. Morgan middleware setup.
2. Commit : MVC architecture setup

   1. **22ac775** Routers setup.
      a. Move tour routes to a tourRouter in a seperate file - tourRouter.js
      b. There routes need routehandlers - so move them to tourRouter.js
      c. Route handlers need mongoose model and shema which need mongoose connection - so move all these to tourRouter.js
   2. **ec19e6b** Controller setup.
      a. Split out routerhandler functions in tourController.js
      b. controller functions need Tour object so spit out all of mongoose code from tourRouter.js to tourController.js
   3. **6fdedfb** Model setup.
      a. Split out all mongoose code i.e. schema and model and Tour model intantiation to tourModel.js
      b. import Tour object to be used by controller.
   4. **500c4d5** Added a small helper script to run independently to import data from json and to delete all data from mongo. Here is how to use it.
      `node ./dev-data/data/import-data.js --delete`

      `node ./dev-data/data/import-data.js --import`
      The code parses the process.argv[2], the 0 arg is node , 1st is ./dev-data/data/import-data.js, we capture second after this to execute relavent function.

3. server and app seperated.
4. Advance queryfiltering.
   1. Capture `req.query` to get all query params
      Issues faced:
      - Mongoexpected query format simple filter `{difficulty:"easy", duration: 5}`. Here req.query capures exactly the same if API query is `/api/v1/tours?difficulty=easy&duration=5`. However first we need to seperate out some special params out of the request body.
   2. Filter out special params out of it : `page, sort, limit, flelds` as these mean some special things. Now request like `/api/v1/tours?difficulty=easy&duration=5&limit=5` would be handled properly by removing `limit=5`from requrest query.
